# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-04)
See: .planning/ROADMAP.md (created 2026-05-04)

**Core value:** A user can navigate a polished, design-faithful UI that matches `frontend/_design-reference/` exactly — sign up, log in, browse home, get a recommendation, and manage preferences/history/watch-later — even though every backend call is currently mocked.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation (issue #90)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-05-04 — ROADMAP.md and STATE.md initialized; 56/56 v1 requirements mapped across 10 phases.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Project init: Next.js 16 + TS + Tailwind app at `frontend/web/` (sibling to `_design-reference/`).
- Project init: Mock module + `localStorage` (not MSW) — single provider swap to real Cognito SDK.
- Project init: 1 GSD phase = 1 GitHub sub-issue = 1 feature branch off `frontend` = 1 PR.
- Project init: Skip Research agent (Lean workflow); stack is fixed by issue #88.
- Project init: Defer `_design-reference/` deletion until just before final `frontend → main` PR.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Issue #88 explicitly blocks Phases 4–10 until Phases 1–3 (issues #90/#91/#92) are merged into `frontend`. Phase ordering enforces this.
- Backend has known issues tracked in `.planning/codebase/CONCERNS.md` (env-var name mismatch, missing PyJWT dep, ~8/11 lambdas not wired). Out of scope this milestone — flagged so the mock-vs-real boundary is explicit when v2 (INTG-01..04) starts.

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Backend integration | INTG-01 Real Cognito SDK | v2 | 2026-05-04 (project init) |
| Backend integration | INTG-02 Real Lambda / API Gateway calls | v2 | 2026-05-04 (project init) |
| Backend integration | INTG-03 Real session refresh / token rotation | v2 | 2026-05-04 (project init) |
| Backend integration | INTG-04 Error UX for real network/auth failures | v2 | 2026-05-04 (project init) |
